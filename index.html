        <h2 class="first-h2">Introduction</h2>

			<p class="paragraph-1-1">
                League of Legends is a strategy game that consists of two teams and each team have their own <u>nexus(pic. 1, 1)</u>, <u>inhibitor(pic. 1, 2)</u>, and <u>three turrets(pic. 1, 3)</u> for each lane.
                <br>The map of league of legends or summoners rift have three different lanes and a jungle on both sides, 
                each with their own players who are playing the role that is
                assigned for that lane. <br> Roles such as a midlaner, adc, support, toplaner, and a jungler each have their important roles that will impact the state of the game as they 
                go along in the future.<br> I will discuss each lanes and the different roles that is present in the game as well as the most common strategies that player who just started playing will need.
